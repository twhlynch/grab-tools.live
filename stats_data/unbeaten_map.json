  "description": "This climb map is harder then Insert's Icey Climb, so you might need to be good climber to beat this. 5 checkpoints, 5 stages of hell.Don't touch this blocks you climb on, you might die. This took 2 hours to make and 4 hours to verify. Also this level has a LOT of neck breakers. This was really fun.",
